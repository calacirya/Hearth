A simple writer with dynamic highlighting for Github-flavored markdown, made with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and :heart:.

This app offers a fullscreen scape without distractions other than the bare minimum needed to compose markdown files, with a dark interface in order to keep your eyes rested.

You may also save your texts with AES encryption in order to keep your files safe from prying eyes.

Version `0.6.0-beta` is out: [check it out!](https://github.com/Nereare/Hearth/releases/tag/v0.6.0-beta) :tada:
